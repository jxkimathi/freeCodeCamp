# Introduction
Hello there!
Welcome to this repository where it documents my experience with [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) and their Courses on Web Development.

# Content
## [Responsive Web Design](./Responsive%20Web%20Design/)
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

* [Cat Photo App](./Responsive%20Web%20Design/Cat%20Photo%20App/) - Learning HTML and CSS in the beginner phase.
